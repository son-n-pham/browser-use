# Browser Use Project Overview

## Project Purpose

The Browser Use project is a Python-based automation tool that provides programmatic control over web browsers for automated tasks, authentication handling, and web interaction. It's designed to be modular, maintainable, and extensible.

It is refactor the main.py file into a more structured and maintainable codebase. The project is divided into multiple phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the refactoring process.

## Key Features

1. **Browser Automation**: Controlled browser interaction and navigation
2. **Authentication Management**: Cookie-based authentication handling
3. **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration for different environments
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery
5. **LLM Integration**: AI-powered task execution capabilities
6. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Core Components

1. Browser Controller

   - Handles browser initialization and control
   - Manages navigation and page interactions
   - Implements error recovery strategies

2. Authentication System

   - Manages cookie-based authentication
   - Handles login flows
   - Secure cookie storage

3. Configuration Management

   - Environment-specific settings
   - Browser configuration
   - Credential management

4. LLM Integration

   - AI model integration
   - Task execution logic
   - Command interpretation

5. Utility System
   - Logging infrastructure
   - Error handling
   - Signal management
   - Dependency injection

## Project Goals

1. Create a modular and maintainable codebase
2. Implement robust error handling and recovery
3. Provide clear separation of concerns
4. Enable easy configuration management
5. Support extensibility for future features
6. Ensure proper testing coverage
7. Maintain comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

1. Review the refactoring phases (01-08)
2. Follow the progress in progress_tracker.md
3. Implement changes incrementally
4. Run tests after each phase
5. Update documentation as needed

## Note

This project is currently undergoing a major refactoring effort to improve its architecture and maintainability. The progress of this effort can be tracked in the progress_tracker.md file.

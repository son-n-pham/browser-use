- âœ… Created browser interfaces
- âœ… Added state capture and navigation

### Phase 6: LLM Integration ðŸŸ¢

- âœ… Implemented ModelClient
- âœ… Created TaskExecutor
- âœ… Added LLM interfaces
- âœ… Implemented task planning and execution

### Phase 7: Main Application Flow ðŸŸ¢

- âœ… Refactored main.py to use new modules

## Test Coverage

- Auth: 100% (5/5 tests passing)
- Browser Controller: 100% (6/6 tests passing)
- Config: 100% (5/5 tests passing)
- LLM Integration: 100% (5/5 tests passing)

## Remaining Tasks

None - All planned phases are complete! The project has been successfully refactored into a modular, well-tested codebase.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more specialized authentication handlers for different websites
2. Expand browser command patterns for complex interactions
3. Add more sophisticated LLM task planning strategies
4. Implement caching for LLM responses
5. Add support for parallel task execution
6. Create a CLI interface for common operations

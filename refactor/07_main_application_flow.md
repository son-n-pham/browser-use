# Phase 7: Main Application Flow

## Objective

Integrate all components into a cohesive executable.

## Tasks

1. Initialize configuration using the new modules
2. Set up Browser Controller and Authentication Handler
3. Listen for user commands and handle tasks
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Use utility functions for graceful shutdown

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Main Application Structure

```python
class BrowserUseApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = None
        self.browser_controller = None
        self.auth_handler = None
        self.dependency_container = None

    async def initialize(self):
        # Setup dependency injection
        # Initialize configuration
        # Setup logging
        # Initialize browser and auth components
        pass

    async def run(self):
        # Main application loop
        # Handle user commands
        # Execute tasks
        pass

    async def shutdown(self):
        # Graceful shutdown
        # Cleanup resources
        pass
```

### 2. Integration Points

1. Configuration initialization and validation
2. Component lifecycle management
3. Error handling and recovery
4. Task execution flow
5. Resource cleanup

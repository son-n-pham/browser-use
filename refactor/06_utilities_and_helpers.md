# Phase 6: Utility Functions and Helpers

## Objective

Enhance the maintainability by centralizing utilities.

## Tasks

### 1. Signal Handling (`utils/signal_handlers.py`)

```python
class SignalHandler:
    def setup_handlers():
        # Setup signal handlers for SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc.
        pass

    async def handle_shutdown():
        # Gracefully shutdown the browser and cleanup resources
        pass
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Create signal handling utilities
2. Implement graceful shutdown procedures
3. Add resource cleanup functions
4. Create helper functions for common operations
5. Add debug and monitoring utilities
